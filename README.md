This client library has been deprecated in favor of the [TokenCredential classes provided in the Azure.Identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.identity?view=azure-dotnet) namespace. You can use the new **TokenCredential** class with [Microsoft.Graph](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Graph/) v4.x and greater.

We suggest that you start with the [v4 upgrade guide](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-dotnet/blob/dev/docs/upgrade-to-v4.md) to learn more about these changes.
